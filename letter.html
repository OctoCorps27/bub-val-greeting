    <p><strong>Hi Bubby!! 💕🌹</strong></p>
    <p>Happy Valentine’s! ❤️ First of all, I just want to say how <strong>thankful and lucky</strong> 😭💖 na we met and to have you in my life. Words can't really express how much thankful I am. 😩💞 Around this time last year, we were about to see each other pa langg, heheheh 😆, and I can't believe how fast time flies! ⏳✨ Now, here we are, together and happy 🥰 with each other. And yes, <strong>may label na</strong> 😏💍, and we have so many experiences together that made us stronger 💪, especially with the <strong>non-negos</strong> 🫶. And yes, you're being yourself now, <strong>no filter na us 100%</strong> 🤪😂. And yes, we’ve experienced so many <strong>firsts</strong> together already, and yes again, I am happy that it's <strong>with you.</strong> 💖</p>

    <p>And also, <strong>thank you, Bubby</strong> 🥹💘 for being my <strong>happy pill</strong> 🤗🌈 always, every time when I'm down 😞, and for always trying to <strong>cheer me up</strong> 😭💞 when I'm not feeling it :((. I want you to know that <strong>I appreciate it so muchhhh.</strong> 😩💕 And yes, Bub, I'm really sorry if sometimes I make you feel <strong>sad</strong> 😔 or <strong>mad</strong> 😡 a lot and make you question if I still <strong>care or love you</strong> 💔 (when you feel unwanted). But yes, <strong>Bubby</strong>, I am reassuring you <strong>again</strong> that <strong>that is NOT true</strong> 🥺💖 because, Bubby, kahit I may not be <strong>always perfect</strong> 🫠, and it will not be the last time that you may feel that way, I want you to know that <strong>you will always have my heart, Bubby.</strong> ❤️‍🔥</p>

    <p>Words cannot express how much <strong>I love you</strong> 😭💘, but I hope and want us to <strong>stay together and not give up</strong> 🥹🤞 because I want to express my <strong>love for you for a lifetime.</strong> 💍💞 Happy Valentines, Bubb, and <strong>please be my Valentine forever!!</strong> 😚💖✨ I hope I can make your day <strong>special.</strong> 🥰🎀</p>
